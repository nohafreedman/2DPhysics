*NOTE: This project is no longer being actively maintained*

The base project code used for the Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development to aid in graphical real-time applications.

Bootstrap is a static library that can be linked against to implement real-time graphical applications with OpenGL as the base API.

To build and run projects ensure that Bootstrap is the first project built, and ensure you have set the Working Directory to the bin folder, i.e. <b>"$(SolutionDir)bin\"</b>.
